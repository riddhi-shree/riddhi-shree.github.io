<p>It all began with a simple question. When Antriksh had asked us if we wanted to do something for c0c0n, we said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; even before deciding what exactly it was that we wanted to do.</p>

<p>Backed with a group of technical, energetic and curious team of young people, Winja team decided to organize the Winja CTF event for c0c0n 2020 Security and Hacking Virtual Conference. In less than two weeks of time, we had to make sure that not only the CTF challenges were ready, but that the CTFd platform was ready too. For a moment it felt like it might be impossible to achieve what we&rsquo;ve committed for, but, looking at the collective energy of the entire team and the constant support provided by Antriksh, everything looked doable. We were all game for it.</p>

<p>After several lengthy discussions, brainstormings, and sleepless nights, we were finally ready with the second Winja CTF of the year 2020 (first being the one <a href="/past-events/winja-ctf-06mar2020/">held at Nullcon Goa on 06-MAR-2020</a>). This time we did not limit ourselevs to women participants. The competition was kept open for all.</p>

<p>We are thankful to <a href="https://india.c0c0n.org/2020/">c0c0n</a> for giving us this wonderful opportunity to host the Winja CTF event on their virtual platform. The virtual booth concept introduced by c0c0n was really interesting. Winja CTF team took turns to be available on the booth and to interact with the visitors.</p>

<p>We are also thankful to <a href="https://nullcon.net/website/">Nullcon</a> for sponsoring the prizes.</p>

<h2 id="the-ctf">The CTF</h2>

<p>Winja CTF team stayed virtually connected on a Zoom call for the entire duration of the CTF. As we watched the competition progress, we felt the same kind of excitement that anyone would feel while watching their favorite game show. The changing graphs were very interesting to look at. Have a look at some of the snapshots that were taken at various points in time, during the competition:</p>

<h2 id="the-ctf-team">The CTF Team</h2>

<p>Guess who had the most fun? Us! While participants had an adrenaline rush for 4 hours, we shared the same feeling for almost two weeks. This incredible feeling was a result of our anticpation, hope and determination. We want to freeze this priceless moment of pride by holding onto the only group pic that we managed to click on the day of the event.</p>
